"""Integration tests for one agent step, with the remaining behavior fixed.

The unit under test is a subtree of the trajectory (Module 2.1): grounding,
or tool-output handling. The model is scripted (FakeModel, the SDK's own
test pattern) and/or the tool is mocked (unittest.mock), so these tests are
cheap and repeatable like unit tests but exercise the REAL Runner loop and
the REAL tool plumbing. They run on every push, with zero API calls.

What each test isolates:

  - Grounding: fix the retrieved-docs set (mock the retrieval tool) and
    assert the model's next-turn context contains exactly those docs. With
    a live model, the follow-on assertion is that the answer cites the store
    override's 14-day figure, not the platform 30-day default; the fixture
    here proves the harness feeds the model the right context, which is the
    half a scripted model can check byte-for-byte.
  - Tool-output handling: mock `issue_refund` to return queued_for_approval
    and assert that truth reaches the model's context verbatim. The
    `tool_result_misreport` failure (saying "processed" when the tool said
    "queued") can only happen after this point, so a live-model version of
    this test asserts the reply says queued; the scripted version pins the
    plumbing half.
  - End state through the real tool: a scripted refund on order #4127
    actually writes an auto_approved refund row, because the real Runner
    executed the real tool against the (copied) seeded world.
